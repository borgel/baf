# baf
*BAF* is a Basic Anmation Framrwork. You could even call it a crummy special purpose schedular of sorts. From a list of "animations" it queues "channel" changes at the interval specified, based on the progression of time.

BAF was written as the upper half of *YABI* [1], which knows how to consume these channel changes and execute them on hardware.

### Future Features
* Actually finishing this
